# techdegree_project_2
 My second techdegree project

- This project uses the principle of progressive enhancement to make the webpage more functional.
- I'm attempting to earn the "Exceed Expectations" grade.
- It takes the html file that contains several li elements related to students information and adds
some features to it:
1) Search box was included
    1.1) The search input will filter out the student as you type letters into it. You can use either
    keyup filter or the search button. Both are functional.
    1.2) If no matching result is found, the page will display a message to inform the user.
2) Page links are functional it is always updated to the page depending on the number of students 
    to be displayed.
    2.1) The max number of students per page link is 10.
