# Pagination and Filtering App
 My second techdegree project

In this project, it's used a commom web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a webpage.
It starts with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. Javascript is used to display 10 names at a time and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

The principle of progressive enhancement is applied. 
The pagination solution works with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied ist of 54 students. This means that the solution is flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths.

- I'm attempting to earn the "Exceed Expectations" grade.
- It takes the html file that contains several li elements related to students information and adds
some features to it:
1) Search box was included
    1.1) The search input will filter out the student as you type letters into it. You can use either
    keyup filter or the search button. Both are functional.
    1.2) If no matching result is found, the page will display a message to inform the user.
2) Page links are functional it is always updated to the page depending on the number of students 
    to be displayed.
    2.1) The max number of students per page link is 10.
